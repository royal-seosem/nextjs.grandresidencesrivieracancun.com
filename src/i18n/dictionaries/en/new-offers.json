Beautiful and well maintained grounds, very clean and well decorated room with 2x day cleaning service. Food at the restaurants was high quality and there were plenty of gluten-free options available. We especially loved the BBQ and tacos themed dinner nights on the beach. Our concierge Iliana was wonderful- she was very helpful and available whenever you needed her. Everyone we met on staff was friendly, from food servers to pool assistants. We loved Sebastian at the swim up bar! Alex was fun and kept us entertained with water aerobics and poolside games every day. The resort does a great job of balancing the couples vs. families experiences so that everyone can have fun in their own way. It truly was a five-star experience. We will definitely return here again!"

        "comment": "I was reluctant to post this because I really don’t want more people to know about this place. This was our fourth time visiting and it is our go-to spot in Mexico. The staff is outstanding; everyone is so friendly, proactive and great with kids. The resort is sparkling clean and the cuisine is so good that I can’t help overeating the whole time. What made this time particularly special was how much our kids loved the kids club - Teresa, Mary and Ivonne - all went above and beyond and made it such a memorable experience for our kids."
